One month ago, on August 1st, version 1.0 of camunda-bpm-migration was released!
In between, things have happened. Most notably, the author of this blog post went on vacation and did not bother writing blog posts ;)
My apologies for this release-and-run misbehaviour!

The release was done because the extension has been stable and it felt right to do it. 
Some people never relase a 1.0 because they think that the product is then finished and ... dead.
But I don't think so. There will be a next relase and will focus on distributing migration plans to different environments.

But now to something completely different...

You'll know what to do with these:

*Maven*
´´´
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.extension.migration</groupId>
    <artifactId>camunda-bpm-migration</artifactId>
    <version>1.0</version>
</dependency>
´´´

*Gradle*
´´´
compile group: 'org.camunda.bpm.extension.migration', name: 'camunda-bpm-migration', version: '1.0'
´´´
